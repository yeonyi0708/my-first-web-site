<h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
<img src="images/JS.jpg" width="70%">
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), <b>often abbreviated as JS</b>, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, <u>alongside HTML and CSS</u>. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), <i>such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities</i>. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p> JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.<p>Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
